ConvertDecks2CramList

Plugin for anki that exports your decks to nicely formatted cram list.
You can choose which decks you want to export to file.

For plugin to work you have to place file ConvertDecks2CramList.py into anki/addons directory that
probably is in your Document directory. After that restart Anki, go to Tools and click ConvertDecks2CramList.
Pick decks you want to export, click export and choose name of file and directory. That's all.

Happy studying.
